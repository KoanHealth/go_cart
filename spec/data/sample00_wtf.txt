The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote
the story substantially for each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur
Dent, a hapless Englishman, although the story also follows the adventure of other major characters: Ford Prefect, who
named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form, automobiles,
is an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook;
Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's semi-cousin and the Galactic President; the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android;
and Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and the only other
human survivor of Earth's destruction.
